# TDS_final_group_1

This is the repo for group1's TDS project: Investigating the causal link between nutrition and lung cancer using a mandelien randomisation approach

The codes should be viewed in the order of how they are labeled, the name for each code file indicates their function in the project and most of the graph produced by the code is in the result_graph folder. The datasets for some results are not included in this repo, if there is need for reviewing specific datasets produced from the code please use the path 

/rds/general/project/hda_students_data/live/Group1/TDS_final_group_1   on the hpc server

The project is divided in the two stages:

stage 1:Initial-analysis \
step0: data pre-processing and data cleaning\
step1:observational analysis and nutrition score construction

stage 2: Mandelian randomisation\
step2:GWAS\
step3:PRS, MR and sentivity checks
